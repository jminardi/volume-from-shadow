volume-from-shadow
==================

Some python code to back project a 3D volume from a series of shadows.

`3d_projection.py` contains the good stuff. `selection_plot.py` is a quick
app to let you define a polygon from an image file.

Here is an example of the point cloud volume produced by this algorithm (cross eyes to view in stereo 3D):

This cloud was generated using the polygons in the input directory
